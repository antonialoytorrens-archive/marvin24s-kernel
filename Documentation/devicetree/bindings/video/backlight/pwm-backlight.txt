pwm-backlight bindings

Required properties:
  - compatible: "pwm-backlight"
  - pwms: OF device-tree PWM specification (see PWM binding[0])
  - brightness-levels: Array of distinct brightness levels. Typically these
      are in the range from 0 to 255, but any range starting at 0 will do.
      The actual brightness level (PWM duty cycle) will be interpolated
      from these values. 0 means a 0% duty cycle (darkest/off), while the
      last value in the array represents a 100% duty cycle (brightest).
  - default-brightness-level: the default brightness level (index into the
      array defined by the "brightness-levels" property)

Optional properties:
  - pwm-names: a list of names for the PWM devices specified in the
      "pwms" property (see PWM binding[0]).
  - power-sequences: Power sequences (see Power sequences[1]) used to bring the
      backlight on and off. If this property is present, then two power
      sequences named "power-on" and "power-off" must be defined to control how
      the backlight is to be powered on and off. These sequences must reference
      the PWM specified in the pwms property by its name, and can also reference
      other resources supported by the power sequences mechanism

Example:

	backlight {
		compatible = "pwm-backlight";
		brightness-levels = <0 4 8 16 32 64 128 255>;
		default-brightness-level = <6>;
		low-threshold-brightness = <50>;

		/* resources used by the power sequences */
		pwms = <&pwm 0 5000000>;
		pwm-names = "backlight";
		power-supply = <&backlight_reg>;

		power-sequences {
			power-on {
				step0 {
					type = "regulator";
					id = "power";
					enable;
				};
				step1 {
					type = "delay";
					delay = <10000>;
				};
				step2 {
					type = "pwm";
					id = "backlight";
					enable;
				};
				step3 {
					type = "gpio";
					gpio = <&gpio 28 0>;
					value = <1>;
				};
			};

			power-off {
				step0 {
					type = "gpio";
					gpio = <&gpio 28 0>;
					value = <0>;
				};
				step1 {
					type = "pwm";
					id = "backlight";
					disable;
				};
				step2 {
					type = "delay";
					delay = <10000>;
				};
				step3 {
					type = "regulator";
					id = "power";
					disable;
				};
			};
		};
	};
